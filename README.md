ETL with Python Project for Cloud Data Engineering

Project Overview

This project involves acquiring and processing data on the world’s largest banks, following a typical ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline. The project is part of the Cloud Data Engineering Roadmap.

Tasks Breakdown

Task 1: Logging Function
Implement a function to track and log the progress of each step in the ETL process.

Task 2: Data Extraction
Extract relevant banking data from external sources.

Task 3: Data Transformation
Clean and standardize the extracted data for further processing.

Task 4: Loading to CSV
Store the transformed data into a CSV file for easy access.

Task 5: Loading to Database
Load the transformed data into a relational database for analysis.

Task 6: Query Execution
Develop a function to run SQL queries directly on the database.

Task 7: Log Verification
Ensure that all log entries are consistent and complete for auditing.
